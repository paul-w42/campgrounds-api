## Project Description

This project will use publicly available data to build a list of publicly 
available camping locations in the State of Washington.  

Ideas for this app include: 

- A page presenting a map view, and as the map is moved, appropriate campgrounds are shown
  - perhaps apply an optional filter, i.e. campground type, etc.
- A list of campgrounds shown given a particular filter, i.e. location, distance, amenities, etc.

From this project I am hoping to re-familiarize myself with Spring using Spring Boot, and to also 
gain experience with React.  Likewise, I will hopefully be doing this while working on a topic
that I quite enjoy!
